massive-happiness
=================

skeleton project with node/express server, dust templates, typescript, plain javascript, preprocessing, and a no-fuss auto-updating makefile.

Project dependencies
--------------------
This project uses NPM to install a couple of dependencies.  You'll need NPM first, though.  If you don't have node and NPM, get them at http://nodejs.org/download/.

You'll also need to install the typescript compiler.  This is best installed globally:
    npm install -g typescript
    
After that, one simple `make` will conditionally compile typescript and templates, preprocess javascript, and make you massively happy.
